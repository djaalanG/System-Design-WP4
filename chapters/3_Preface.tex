%Preface
This report is part of a series of five reports regarding a preliminary design of a large passenger aircraft. It was prepared by 11 Aerospace Engineering students at the TU Delft. The aim of this particular report is to determine the preliminary structural design of the wing, including an initial design of the wing box. These stiffness-centered considerations will lay the foundation for the detailed wing design, the focus of the final reports in this series.\\

\noindent The intended public of this report are readers with a fundamental understanding of aerodynamics, aircraft design, and systems engineering. Hence, background knowledge in Aerospace Engineering concepts is assumed in the writing. \\

\noindent Readers interested in the derivation of shear force, bending moment and torsion diagrams shall refer to \autoref{ch:ForceDiagram}, while those seeking information on stiffness calculations are encouraged to consult \autoref{ch:Stiff_Calc}. Additionally, a preliminary wing box design is described in \autoref{ch:Prelim_WB_Des} for those interested in choosing the most suitable design options for aircraft structures.\\

\noindent We would like to extend our sincere thanks to our mentor, M. Pluciński, for his guidance and expertise throughout the preliminary design phase of the project.\\
